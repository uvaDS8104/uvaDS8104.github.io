I will try to respond to all course-related e-mails within 24 hours (yup), but also remember that life can be busy and chaotic for everyone (including me!), so if I don\u0026rsquo;t respond right away, don\u0026rsquo;t worry!\nAbout the course Networks provide a unifying framework to study the structure hidden within complex data. This graduate-level course focuses on the fundamental concepts and statistics as well as recent advancements and applications of network science. Topics include: graph theory, structural paradoxes, measures and algorithms for quantifying importance, community detection, network inference, recommendation systems, and link prediction.\nWhat You Will Learn Along the Way In this class, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to think like a network scientist and become familar with the tools we use to uncover the secerts of network structures.\nBy the end of the course, students are expected to be able to identify, construct, and analyze networks by choosing and applying appropriate methods and algorithms. Students are also expected to be able to explain, both mathematically and conceptually, the key network concepts and statistical properties, and their implications.\nAs an upper-level PhD course, students will also be exposed to scientific communication and open debates in network science. We will discuss soft science skills, including argumentation, presentation, and visual storytelling.\nCourse Structure This course employs a combination of instructor lead lectures and student-lead discussion. Students are required to read assigned readings, attend (watch) the lectures, complete their project assignments, and engage in (online) discussions.\nEvery week, each student will be required to introduce an article and moderate the class’s discussion, and all students are expected to participate. Technical evaluation will be based on a final project. Students may choose any network-related topics that involve network analysis or modeling, although it is strongly encouraged to discuss with the instructor about the project topics.\nCourse materials All required readings and resources are available on the course website.\nArticles, and other materials In this course, we will be reading scientific articles. Two great commentaries to get you in the mindset for digesting scientific articles are:\nHow to seriously read a scientific paper. Ten simple rules for reading a scientific paper Textbooks There are several fantastic treatments of Network Science. None of these are required readings, but they have all greatly influenced the way I think about networks.\nBarabasi (2016) Network Science. A comprehensive and easy to read guided tour. Its Free or in print at Amazon.\nNewman (2018) Networks: An Introduction. The network bible, now updated! Its a book you will continuely reference. Amazon\nEasley \u0026amp; Kleinberg (2010) Networks, crowds, and markets: Reasoning about a highly connected world.

Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this stuff for years!).\nFortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. The most important is StackOverflow (a Q\u0026amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions).\nDive Into Python by Mark Pilgrim (available online): a good Python book.\nAn introduction to statistics (with Python) by Thomas Haslwanter (available online): this book uses Python to explain basic statistics. It also contains a succinct tutorial for Python and data visualization using Python.\nLearn Git and Github\nNetworkx Basics\nAI writing I fully encourage you to leverage the latest writing assitance software, for example ChatGPT. Its fun, and already changing the way I approach writing, especially getting over writers block. The flip side is, I will be paying more attention to the accuracy of scientific content.\nCourse policies Be nice. Be honest. Don\u0026rsquo;t cheat.\nWe will also abid by the University of Virginia Honor System.\nThis syllabus reflects a plan for the semester. Deviations may become necessary (and are likely) as the course progresses.\nStudent hours Student hours are set times dedicated to all of you. I love to talk about networks; also data, science, meta-science, hockey, and really anything else that is pressing on your mind. I\u0026rsquo;m saving the hour after our class from any other disruptions, so please do make the most of it.\nNote: You are always welcome to email me to setup a one-on-one meeting.\nClass conduct and expectations Here are the rules, expectations, and policies that we came up with collectively:\nParticipation: Ensure that you are engaged and participate in class. If you\u0026rsquo;ve never taken a seminar course before, this means commenting on articles, discussing alternative analysis, and arguing for or against the main points. Science is actually a lot messier than most professors want you to believe. Technology use: Use phones, computers, etc. responsibly. You\u0026rsquo;re all adults. Learning during a pandemic It aint over yet!\nYou most likely know people who have lost their jobs, have tested positive for COVID-19, have been hospitalized, or perhaps have even died. You all have increased (or possibly decreased) work responsibilities and increased family care responsibilities—you might be caring for extra people (young and/or old!) right now, and you are likely facing uncertain job prospects (or have been laid off!).\nI\u0026rsquo;m fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! I will make whatever accommodations I can to help you finish your exercises, do well on your projects, and learn and understand the class material. Under ordinary conditions, I am flexible and lenient with grading and course expectations when students face difficult challenges.\nStudent Mental Health and Wellbeing: The University of Virginia is committed to advancing the mental health and wellbeing of its students, while acknowledging that a variety of issues, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, and depression, directly impacts students’ academic performance. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. For help, contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 434-243-5150 Monday-Friday, 8:00am-4:30pm and after-hours including weekends and holidays. For a comprehensive list of services provided by CAPS including individual therapy, group therapy, crisis services, and Outreach and Consultation, visit https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps.\nFor a list of online resources students may access independently, visit https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps-online-resources.\nFor access to community mental health referrals, visit https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/community-referrals.\nStudent Safety \u0026amp; Title IX The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that we and the University hold as critically important:\nPower-based personal violence will not be tolerated. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website, which describes reporting options and resources available.\nAs your professors, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, we are responsible employees, which means that we are required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell us to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds.\nThere are also other University of Virginia resources available. As noted above, the Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) for its students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and confidentially over the phone, call Madison House’s HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with gender, sexual, or domestic violence, there are many community and University of Virginia resources available. The Office of the Dean of Students, Sexual Assault Resource Agency (SARA), Shelter for Help in Emergency (SHE), and UVA Women’s Center are ready and eager to help. Contact the Director of Sexual and Domestic Violence Services at 434-982-2774.\nDiversity and Inclusion The School of Data Science expects everyone to contribute to an inclusive and respectful classroom culture that reflects the School’s commitment to being a space in which you can find true belonging and a sense of shared community. The diversity (referring to the multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information) of our classroom is a strength. You are expected to respectfully embrace the opportunity to engage, collaborate, and learn with/from a diverse team of classmates.\nAdditionally, I will note that it is possible that, even though our course material is primarily scientific in nature, there may be covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written. I welcome feedback and suggestions to improve upon the inclusivity of the material. We are all responsible for ensuring that our actions/experience align with our stated values. Please consider yourselves to be my accountability partners in creating an inclusive environment that supports a diversity of perspectives, do not hesitate to reach out if you have concerns, ideas, or questions about your experience.\nAs part of our shared effort to promote a classroom culture of inclusion, we will each have the opportunity to indicate our preferred name and pronouns. I will do my best to refer to all students accordingly.\nIf you find yourself in need of additional support, please consider the following resources:\nSDS Associate Dean for DEI, Siri Russell ssr5v@virginia.edu UVA Just Report It Song Request Once you have read this entire syllabus, please click here and e-mail me the music vidoe for your favorite work-out / moving / walking / dancing song.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674147674,"objectID":"0d09127d49a82b0e72d63da5772d010e","permalink":"https://uvaDS8104.github.io/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Instructor Dr. Alexander Gates 164A Elson Hall agates@virginia.edu @complexgates Schedule an appointment Course details Tu, Th January 19 - April 27, 2023 2:00pm - 3:15pm Elliwood Conference Room Contacting me E-mail is the best way to get in contact with me.
